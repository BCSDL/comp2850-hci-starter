## Purpose Statement  
We are conducting short peer interviews (5–10 minutes) to understand how people interact with task management tools, identify usability pain points, and gather insights for improving accessibility. This research supports coursework for Weeks 6–11 of the COMP2850 module.  

## What Participants Will Do  
You will be asked 3–5 questions about your experience with task managers (e.g., "Describe a time you struggled to organize tasks" or "What features help you stay on track?"). I will take brief written notes during the discussion. **No audio, video, or screen recordings will be made**.  

## Data Collected (and NOT Collected)  
- **Collected**:  
  - Pseudonymised notes (e.g., "Participant B mentioned...")  
  - Timestamps of the interview  
  - Contextual tags (e.g., "Uses keyboard-only navigation", "Prefers dark mode")  

- **NOT Collected** (no PII):  
  - Names, student IDs, or email addresses  
  - Device identifiers or personal data  
  - Any information that could identify you individually  

## Data Storage Location and Duration  
- **Storage**: Notes will be stored in a private local Git repository on my laptop. Only I, my lab partner, and module teaching staff (for marking purposes) will have access.  
- **Duration**: Data will be retained until the end of Semester 1 (January 2026), then either deleted or fully anonymised for portfolio use.  

## Participant Rights (UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018)  
- **Right to withdraw**: You may stop the interview at any time without explanation.  
- **Right to access**: You can request to review your pseudonymised notes at any time.  
- **Right to erasure**: You can ask to delete all data related to you; I will confirm deletion within 48 hours.  
- **Right to complain**: Contact the University Data Protection Officer at dpo@leeds.ac.uk with concerns.
