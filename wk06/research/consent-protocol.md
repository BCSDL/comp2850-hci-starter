# Consent & Protocol (Peers only, no PII)

**Module**: COMP2850 Human-Computer Interaction  
**Activity**: Low-risk needs-finding interviews and usability testing with peers  
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Researcher**: [Yiming Xu 201751643]  


## Purpose  
We are conducting short peer interviews and usability tests (5-10 minutes) to understand how people interact with task management tools and identify accessibility improvements. This activity is part of HCI coursework (Weeks 6-11) to inform interface design and inclusive feature development.  


## What You'll Do  
- You will be asked 3-5 questions about your experience with task managers (e.g., "Tell me about a time you struggled to complete a task").  
- You may be asked to perform simple tasks in a prototype (e.g., adding or editing a task).  
- Think-aloud is optional (you can share your thoughts as you interact, but it’s not required).  
- You can stop at any time without explanation.  


## Data Collected  
### What will be collected:  
- Pseudonymised notes (e.g., "Participant A noted confusion with edit buttons").  
- Timestamps of interactions (e.g., "Took 20 seconds to submit a task").  
- Error counts (e.g., "1 failed submission due to empty input").  
- Contextual tags (e.g., "Uses keyboard only", "Prefers screen reader").  
- Cropped screenshots of the interface (no personal info visible).  

### What will NOT be collected:  
- Names, student IDs, emails, or usernames.  
- Audio/video recordings (no recordings of any kind).  
- Device details, IP addresses, or other personally identifiable information (PII).  


## Data Storage  
- Data will be stored locally on my laptop in a private Git repository.  
- Access is limited to me, my lab partner, and module teaching staff (for marking purposes only).  
- Data will be retained until the end of Semester 1 (January 2025), then deleted or fully anonymised for portfolio submission.  


## Your Rights (UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018)  
- **Right to withdraw**: You can stop participation at any time with no penalty.  
- **Right to access**: You can request to view your anonymised data (e.g., notes about your session).  
- **Right to erasure**: You can ask to delete your data by emailing me with the interview date and your pseudonym. I will confirm deletion within 48 hours.  
- **Right to complain**: Contact the University Data Protection Officer with concerns: dpo@leeds.ac.uk.
