# Interview Notes — Week 6 (November 6–13, 2025)

## Participant A  
**Date**: 2025-11-08 14:30  
**Context**: Uses keyboard-only navigation; no mouse  

| time       | task                          | observation                                                                 | issue_tag           | severity |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| 14:31      | Adding a task                 | Hesitated before pressing Enter; unsure if form would submit without mouse  | keyboard_ambiguity  | Medium   |
| 14:33      | Deleting a task               | Could not find delete button via Tab navigation (hidden from focus order)   | focus_management    | High     |
| 14:35      | Reviewing task list           | Complained list lacks visual hierarchy; hard to scan quickly                | visual_scanability  | Low      |

**Key Quotes**:  
- "I never know if the Enter key works on forms—sometimes it does, sometimes not."  
- "If I can't reach a button with Tab, it might as well not exist."  


## Participant B  
**Date**: 2025-11-10 10:15  
**Context**: Uses screen reader (NVDA); prefers concise status messages  

| time       | task                          | observation                                                                 | issue_tag           | severity |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| 10:16      | Adding a task                 | Screen reader did not announce "task added" confirmation                    | sr_feedback         | High     |
| 10:18      | Editing a task (hypothetical) | Expressed need for inline edit; "new pages for edits waste time"            | workflow_efficiency | Medium   |
| 10:20      | Error handling                | "I hate when forms just fail silently—tell me what I did wrong!"            | error_clarity       | Medium   |

**Key Quotes**:  
- "If the screen reader doesn't confirm it, I don't trust it's done."  
- "Edits should be quick—no extra clicks or pages."
